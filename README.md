Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a group of developmental disorders that manifests as deficits in social interaction and communication. However, it we do not know if ASD individuals show deficits in perceiving sensory stimuli.

Deficits in sensory perception can manifest in two ways. First, ASD individuals may not be able to perceive sensory stimuli (e.g., vision, audio, touch) as well as neurologically-intact (control) individuals.

Second, ASD individuals may not be able to combine different pieces of sensory information as well as their control counterparts. For e.g., when control individuals see a flash of light and hear a beep near it, they combine both pieces of information to improve how well they localize the stimuli. This improvement in the presence of visual and auditory stimuli manifests as increased precision (i.e., sensitivity, inverse threshold) . In fact, threshold in the presence of both flash and beep can be predicted by a Bayesian model.

𝜎2𝑐𝑜𝑚=𝜎2𝑣𝑖𝑠𝜎2𝑎𝑢𝑑𝜎2𝑣𝑖𝑠+𝜎2𝑎𝑢𝑑

𝜎𝑣𝑖𝑠
and 𝜎𝑎𝑢𝑑

represent the threshold of subject's performance when flash and beep are presented alone, respectively.

It is not clear if the precision with which ASD individuals localize the position of flash and beep follows the predictions of the Bayesian model.

The data presented here was collected from behavioral experiments in ASD and control subjects. Subjects viewed a flash, or heard a beep or viewed flash/heard a beep at the same time. Subjects indicated if the stimlus (stimuli) was to the left or right of straight-ahead. The flash can be small, medium or large-sized. Smaller the flash, easier it is to determine if it is to th left or right. Therefore, small flash --> high reliability, and large flash --> low reliability.

I explore the data of ASD and control individuals to answer these two questions: (1) Do ASD subjects perceive flash or beep differently? That is, are thresholds (estimated by fitting cumulative gaussian functions to subject's binary responses) similar between the groups?

(2) Do ASD subjects combine flash and beep as per Bayesian model predictions? That is, do thresholds empirically measured when flash and beep are presented together match the predictions of Bayesian model?
