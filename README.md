Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a group of developmental disorders that manifests as deficits in social interaction and communication. However, it we do not know if ASD individuals show deficits in perceiving sensory stimuli.

Deficits in sensory perception can manifest in two ways. First, ASD individuals may not be able to perceive sensory stimuli (e.g., vision, audio, touch) as well as neurologically-intact (control) individuals.

Second, ASD individuals may not be able to combine different pieces of sensory information as well as their control counterparts. For e.g., when control individuals see a flash of light and hear a beep near it, they combine both pieces of information to improve how well they localize the stimuli. This improvement in the presence of visual and auditory stimuli manifests as increased precision (i.e., sensitivity, inverse threshold)  and can be predicted by a Bayesian model. 

It is not clear if the precision with which ASD individuals localize the position of flash and beep follows the predictions of the Bayesian model.

I explore the data of ASD and control individuals to answer these two questions: (1) Do ASD subjects perceive flash or beep differently? 

(2) Do ASD subjects combine flash and beep as per Bayesian model predictions?
